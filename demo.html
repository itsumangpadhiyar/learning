                    <h2>Limitless learning, more  possibilities</h2>
                    <p>The University of Rochester is one of the country's top-tier research universities. Our campuses are home to 200 academic majors, more than 2,000 faculty and instructional staff, and some 10,000 studentsâ€”approximately half of whom are women.</p>
                    <p>Learning at the University of Rochester is also on a very personal scale. Rochester remains one of the smallest and most collegiate among top research universities, with smaller classes, a low 10:1 student to teacher ratio, and increased interactions with faculty.</p>
